# 📱 Nothing Phone Website - Hackathon Project

This project was created as part of a hackathon organized by *Shreyains Coding School*.  
The theme was to design a *Startup or Influencer Website, and I chose to redesign the official website of the **Nothing Phone* brand.
---
Using React, I focused on building a smooth, interactive user experience with scroll animations, clean layouts, and modern UI inspired by the original Nothing aesthetic.
It includes multiple sections like hero, product display, custom canvas interactions, and animated transitions.
